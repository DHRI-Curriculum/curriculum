# A string is a set of characters, either letters, numbers, or symbols

# You can use these characters to start and end strings:
# Single quote: '
# Double quote: "
# Triple quote: ''' (can be used for multiline string)

# Don't mix and match! Always have the same mark at the beginning and end of the string.
