## Python resources

[Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) - An example-driven introduction to Python.

[How to Think Like a Computer Scientist - Python Edition](http://interactivepython.org/courselib/static/thinkcspy/index.html) - A good intro if you're also interested in learning basic computer science concepts.

[Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) - A fun book that teaches Python while automating some common (and annoying) tasks.

[CodeAcademy: Python](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python) - An interactive tutorial for learning the basics of Python. (I recommend trying the books above first, as learning to use a text editor or IDE such as IPython or IDLE is an important part of the learning curve.) A good supplemental resource.
