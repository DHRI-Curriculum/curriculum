### Installation

For these exercises, we will be using Anaconda, a version of Python that comes packaged with useful libraries for working with natural language and scientific data. 

To download Anaconda, [follow this link](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) and click the button for your operating system and Python 3.x (3.6 at the time of this writing). You want the 64-bit, graphical installer version.

After installation, to test that Anaconda is working correctly, type 

    $ python --version

in your terminal. If Anaconda is working, your output should look like this:

	Python 3.6.4:: Anaconda 2.5.0 (64-bit)

Note that to get this output you may need to refresh your terminal by typing `exec $SHELL` in the prompt (including the `$`) or by closing and reopening the terminal.
