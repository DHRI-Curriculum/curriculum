## Lists and Loops

### Lists

Remember lists? They look like this:

	flowers = ['rose', 'violet', 'buttercup']
	
For now, let's just create a list and print it out. Our script will look like this:

```
flowers = ['rose', 'violet', 'buttercup']
print(flowers)
```

Save this to a new file called `loop.py` and run it with `python loop.py`. You should see the list printed out in the terminal.

So far, we've only learned one function: `type()`. Let's try out another:

```
flowers = ['rose', 'violet', 'buttercup']
# print(flowers)

list_length = len(flowers)

print(list_length)
```

The `len()` function returns the number of items in a list or the number of characters in a string.

Notice that, if you run the code above, you won't see the `flowers` list printed out. That's because that line has become a comment. If you put a `#` (hash or pound) at the beginning of a line, that line will be ignored.

### Loops

What if we want to print out each item in the list separately? For that, we'll need something called a loop:

```
flowers = ['rose', 'violet', 'buttercup']
# print(flowers)
for flower in flowers:
    print("My favorite flower is the", flower)
```

What's happening here? This kind of loop is called a "for" loop, and tells Python: "for each item in the list, do something." Let's break it down:

```
for <variable name> in <list name>:
	<do something>
```

Indented code like this is known as a "code block." Python will run the <do something> code in the code block once for each item in the list. You can also refer to \<variable name> in the <do something> block.

You can also perform more complicated operations. Let's tackle one in a challenge.

### Challenge

Here's a list of numbers:

```
prime_numbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]
```

Write some code to print out the square of each of these numbers. The solution is [here](loop.py), but you're not allowed to look at it until you've tried to solve it yourself for 3.5 minutes. Seriously. That's 210 seconds.

### Advanced Challenge

First, ignore this challenge because it's too hard. Next, look up string formatting on Google and use it to write a loop that gives the following output:

```
The square of 2 is 4.
The square of 3 is 9.
The square of 5 is 25.
The square of 7 is 49.
The square of 11 is 121.
```
