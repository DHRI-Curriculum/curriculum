# Using Git and GitHub to Manage Collaborative Workflow!

In your browser on your own computer, follow this workshop at [http://github.com/jojokarlin/Git_DRI_Jan_2017](https://github.com/jojokarlin/Git_DRI_Jan_2017)

In this workshop, we're going to learn how to use Git, GitHub and markdown in order to develop a workflow for collaborative, version-controlled projects in digital environments. 

#### _If you have yet to, sign up for a GitHub account..._ 

Register for a GitHub account [here](http://github.com/](http://github.com/).

Open up Sublime and record your username, email, and password in the projects folder you created on your Desktop yesterday. Save the file using an easy to remember name for now, like "github_setup" - you will need this information twice more!
