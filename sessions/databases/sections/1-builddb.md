# Building a database

To get started, we're going to use the SQLiteStudio GUI to create the database file we will be using during this session. (We will also use the same file in a later session on web frameworks.)

1. Create a database file using the SQLite GUI by clicking Databases > Add a Database from the file menu:

2. Give your database a name and make sure to save it to a directory that is outside of the SQLiteStudio download folder.

3. Connect to the database you just created. First click the database in the left pane to highlight it, then select Databases > Connect to the Database from the file menu:
