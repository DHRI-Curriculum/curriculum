# Pause and reflect

### Why learn relational databases when I know Excel?

1. ##### Data integrity  
	- Databases force every value in a particular field to be one data type  

2. ##### Volume, volume, volume...  
	- Does the thought of working with a 98,000-row Excel spreadsheet make you queasy? What about 5 million rows?

3. ##### Working with multiple related data sets  
	- Is anyone not doing this???  

4. ##### Asking detailed questions about your data  

5. ##### Connecting your data  
	- Databases are ready to plug into other applications
