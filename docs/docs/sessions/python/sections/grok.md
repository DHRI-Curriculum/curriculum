## Grok

Grok is a word that appears in Robert Heinlein's novel *Stranger in a Strange Land*. Literally, it means "to drink." Metaphorically, it means to internalize somethingâ€”to make it part of yourself. Programmers have picked up the word *grok* and use it to indicate a deep understanding of a concept.

You certainly don't have to understand programming concepts deeply to get a lot of use out of programming. However, sometimes taking some time out to step back and learn the ins and outs of an idea will allow you to avoid hitting cognitive roadblocks, making it possible to write and understand more complex programs.

If you find yourself stressed out by working with code you don't understand, break it down into compoenents. Then write short throwaway programs, one to five lines, that explore the concepts or language features that you don't fully understand. When you grok the components, you'll be better prepared to tackle the larger whole.
