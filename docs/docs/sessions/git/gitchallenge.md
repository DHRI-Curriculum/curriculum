# Challenge yourself

## Challenge 

- Create a README.md file in your GitPractice directory

- Save, stage, commit, and push your new file to your remote repo.

**hint** use a combination of command line and git commands.



## EXTRA Challenge
### Not for the faint of heart

- Initialize `git init` a *new* repository by navigating to your own project folder. 
- choose a directory you wish to track (it can be the cheatsheet directory or databases directory you made in the command line workshop)
- connect your local directory to your GitHub account
- put up your sticky note when you have made an initial commit to your GitHub
