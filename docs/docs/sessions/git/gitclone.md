## Cloning

A **clone** is a local copy of a repository.

`git clone [URL of your GitHub repo]`

This clones a remote repo to your computer so you can customize it to your taste. 

**First, make sure you are out of GitPractice before you clone.** Let's navigate to the Desktop. 

Clone the [repo for this workshop](https://github.com/jojokarlin/Git_DRI_Jan_2017) so you can have a copy for yourself!

`git clone https://github.com/jojokarlin/Git_DRI_Jan_2017`

Also, you can use the GUI (graphical user interface) on GitHub (buttons on the web page) to do the same thing. There should be a little "clone or download" button near the top right of each repo. 

You can find all the workshops from this week linked in Patrick Smyth's [GCDRI 2017 schedule](https://github.com/smythp/gcdri_schedule_2017). You can `clone` individual repositories of those workshops you might wish to revisit or that you might wish to copy to teach yourself.
