## Text Editors 

An important tool for programming and working in the command line is a text editor. A text editor is a program that allows you to edit plain text files, such as .txt, .csv, or .md. Text editors are not used to edit rich text documents, such as .docx or .rtf, and rich text editors should not be used to edit plain text files. This is because rich text editors will add many invisible special characters that will prevent programs from running and configuration files from being read correctly. 

While it doesn't really matter which text editor you choose, you should try to become comfortable with at least one text editor. 

### Default Recommendation

If you don't want to bother thinking about which text editor to use, we recommend using [TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/) for OSX or [Notepad ++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) for Windows.

### Editors vs. IDEs

When it comes to editing text and writing code, you can use either a text editor or an IDE (cIntegrated Development Environment). Text editors tend to be more lightweight solutions, while IDEs try to provide a lot of features to help you write code and tend to target specific languages. There are a lot of exceptions to that description, but the distinction isn't that important. Just know that editors will sometimes describe themselves as IDEs, and that there's a slight difference in philosophy between 

### Which Text Editor Should I Choose?

#### OSX

- [Textwrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/) - Simple graphical text editor that is easy to use. If you're used to the Mac way of doing things, TextWrangler should make sense to you. One potential disadvantage is that Textwrangler won't do things like automatically indent Python code.

### Platform Independent

- **[IDLE]()https://docs.python.org/2/library/idle.html** - The default Python IDE that comes bundled with every download of Python. Simple to use and good for beginners to Python. Not very polished and lacks advanced features.
- **Spyder** and **PyCharm** - These are Python-specific IDEs. They have more bells and whistles than a standard text editor like Textwrangler, but they're meant specifically for working with Python. Spyder is free and comes bundled with Anaconda. PyCharm is not free, but some people prefer it for working with Python on the web.
