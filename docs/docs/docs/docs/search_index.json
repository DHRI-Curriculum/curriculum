Object]\nNaNOverviewThe GC Digital Research Institute (GCDRI) is a week-long course in digital research methods held at The Graduate Center, CUNY. Organized by Graduate Center Digital Initiatives (GCDI), this intensive course is designed to provide an accessible introduction to technologies frequently used in serious digital research, including the command line, databases, the Python programming language, and the git version control system. Building on these core skills, later sessions in the GCDRI focus on more specialized approaches, such as natural language processing, machine learning, mapping, and data collection with APIs.This document provides a high-level overview of the GCDRI pedagogical model and presents the curriculum from the core and supplementary technical sessions. It also collates informational sessions on critical skills such as grant writing, sustainability, time management, and outreach.BackgroundThe GCDRI grew out of the work of the Digital Fellows, an interdisciplinary team of graduate students dedicated to developing and supporting digital approaches to research and pedagogy at the Graduate Center. The Fellows hold office hours, work with students and faculty, and lead a popular series of technical workshops each semester. Through this work, the Fellows became conscious of a need for a more sustained approach to teaching digital methods. While workshops, and workshop series, were well-received, there was little room during a busy semester to build the fundamental competencies that serve as a foundation for sustained inquiry and scholarship using digital methods.In recent years, alternative models for collaboration and pedagogy such as bootcamps, sprints, and hackathons have become the norm in the technology industry. These approaches emphasize close collaboration and sustained, intensive effort over a short period of time to reach a desired goal. For sprints and hackathons, this can be the creation of a project or feature over the course of a few hours or days. For bootcamps, the goal is usually to train participants in specialized technical skills in the space of a few weeks or months. Though some bootcamps and hackathons have been criticized for their overt commercialization and exploitative practices, these models have also been embraced by nonprofits and the open source community.The intensive pedagogical model has also been taking root within the academy. The nonprofit Software Carpentry Foundation, for example, teaches technical skills useful in the sciences. In addition, organizations such as Humanities Intensive Teaching and Learning (HILT) and the Digital Humanities Summer Institute (DHSI) offer intensive courses for practitioners in the digital humanities, often with a conference component.Inspired by these models of intensive training both in and out of the academy, and with the generous assistance of a CUNY Strategic Investment Initiative grant, GCDI introduced the Digital Research Institute in summer 2015. Heavy demand for placement led to an expansion of the Institute from 30 participants in 2015 to 60 in summer 2016. The Institute, reflecting the interdisciplinary concerns of GCDI and the Digital Fellows, was designed to engage scholars in the sciences, social sciences, and  humanities. This is achieved by combining a foundational core in four flexible and widely used technologies with supplemental sessions in areas of more specialized interest. The Institute also emphasizes skills that contribute to the growth of a community of sustainable digital practice at the GC, offering workshops on outreach, grant writing, and project life cycle management. \n\n"},"philosophy.html":{"url":"philosophy.html","title":"Philosophy","keywords":"","body":"PhilosophySessions at the Digital Research Institute are divided into three categories: core, which provide a general foundation on which to build more specialized skills; supplemental, electives which are more likely to be more useful to researchers in specific areas or disciplines,; and professional development, which focus on non-technical skills necessary for undertaking successful projects."},"core.html":{"url":"core.html","title":"Core Sessions","keywords":"","body":"Core SessionsThe DRI's core sessions teach four flexible skills that provide a foundation for more specialized learning later in the week.

Let's try our first command. Type the following and press enter:$ whoami\nThe whoami command should print out your username. Congrats, you've executed your first command! This is a basic pattern of use in the command line: type a command and receive output.Orienting yourself in the command line: foldersOK, we're going to try another command. But first, let's make sure we understand some things about how your computer's filesystem works.Your computer's files are organized in what's known as a hierarchical filesystem. That means there's a top level or \"root\" folder on your system. That folder has other folders in it, and those folders have folders in them, and so on. You can draw these relationships in a tree:Users\n|\n-- patrick\n  |\n  -- Photos\n  -- Documents\nThe root or highest-level folder on OSX is just called /. We won't need to go in there, though, since that's mostly just files for the operating system. On Windows, the root directory is usually called C:.OK, let's try a command that tells us where we are in the filesystem:$ pwd\nYou should get output like /Users/patrick. That means you're in the patrick directory in the Users folder inside the / or root directory. On Windows, your output would instead be C:/Users/patrick. The folder you're in is called the working directory, and pwd stands for \"print working directory.\"OK, we know where we are. But what if we want to know what files and folders are in the patrick directory, a.k.a. the working directory? Try entering:ls\nYou should see a number of folders, probably including Documents, Desktop, and so on. You may also see some files. These are the contents of the current working directory.I wonder what's in the Desktop folder? Let's try moving to it with the following command:$ cd Desktop\n(Make sure the \"D\" in \"Desktop\" is capitalized. ) If the command was successful, you won't see any output. This is normal—often, the command line will succeed silently.So how do we know it worked? That's right, let's use our pwd command again. We should get:$ pwd\n/Users/patrick/Desktop\nNow try ls again to see what's on your desktop. These three commands—pwd, ls, and cd—are the most commonly used in the terminal. Between them, you can orient yourself and move around. Before we move on, let's take a minute to move around in the command line.ChallengeUse the three commands you've just learned—pwd, ls and cd—eight (8) times each. Go poking around your Photos folder, or see what's so special about that scary root / directory. When you're done, come back to the home folder withcd ~\n(That's a tilde, on the top left of your keyboard.) One more command you might find useful iscd ..\nwhich will move you one directory up in the filesystem. That's a cd with two periods after it.Example:"},"intro-command-line/sections/creating-files-and-folders.html":{"url":"intro-command-line/sections/creating-files-and-folders.html","title":"Creating files and folders","keywords":"","body":"Creating files and foldersCreating a folderSo far, we've only performed commands that give us information.

Now move the terminal window and look at your \"real\" desktop, the graphical one. See any differences? If the command was successful and you were in the right place, you should see an empty text file called \"foo.txt\" on the desktop.

You can use it to keep track of all the awesome commands you're learning.Instead of creating an empty file like we did with touch, let's try creating a file with some text in it. But first, let's learn a new command: echo$ echo \"Hello from the command line\"\nHello from the command line\nBy default, the echo command just prints out the text we give it. Let's use it to create a file with some text in it:echo \"This is my cheat sheet\" > cheat-sheet.txt\nNow let's check the contents of the directory:$ pwd\n/Users/patrick/projects\n$ ls\ncheat-sheet.txt\nOK, so the file has been created. But what was the > in the command we used? On the command line, a > is known as a \"redirect.\" It takes the output of a command and puts it in a file. Be careful, since it's possible to overwrite files with the > command.Let's check if there's any text in cheat-sheet.txt.cat cheat-sheet.txt\nThis is my cheat sheet\nAs you can see, the cat command prints the contents of a file to the screen.Using a text editorThe challenge for this section will be using a text editor to add some of the commands that we've learned to the newly created cheat sheet. Text editors are programs that allow you to edit plain text files, such as .txt, .py (Python scripts), and .csv (spreadsheet files).

It's in .csv format, which is a plain text spreadsheet format. CSV stands for \"comma separated values,\" and each field in the spreadsheet is separated with a comma. It's all still plain text, though, so we can manipulate the data using the command line.Viewing data in the command lineTry using cat to look at the data. You'll find it all goes by too fast to get any sense of it. (You can do Control-C to cancel the output if it's taking too long.)Instead, let's use another tool to get the data one page at a time:$ less nypl_items.csv\n[...]\nThis gives you a paginated view of the data. You can use Control-v and Alt-vto move down or up one page. (On Macs, use  and .)

The wc tool stands for \"word count,\" but it can also count characters and lines in a file. We tell wc to count lines by using the -l flag.

Let's try it out:$ cat nypl_items.csv | uniq | wc -l\n99999\nOK, the count went down by two because the uniq command removed the duplicate lines.

If you complete all of them, you'll have a good sense of the various ways to create your own commands in the terminal, from creating aliases to writing your own bash scripts.Challenge #1: Create hidden fileUse the touch command to create a hidden file. Hidden files have a . in front of them, like this:$ ls -A\n.gitignore hello.txt\n$ ls\nhello.txt\nYou can also create hidden folders this way, but you only need to create a file to pass the challenge.Challenge #2: Create an aliasAll these commands are great and all, but what if I want to make my own command? For example, maybe I want to make this happen:$ peptalk\nPatrick is awesome!\nTo do this, use the alias command:$ alias peptalk=\"echo 'Patrick is awesome!'\"\nTo pass this challenge, make your own alias that does something different.Challenge #3: Make a permanent aliasSo you made an alias, but you realized it goes away when you close and reopen the terminal. (So unfair.) Make your alias permanent.To do this, you will need to edit the configuration file that your terminal runs when it starts up. On Git Bash, that's going to be called ~/.bashrc. (That's a .bashrc file in your home folder.) ON OSX, the file is called ~/.bash_profile. Just add the command you used to create the alias to the file with your text editor. Close and reopen the terminal to make sure your alias still works.Challenge #4: Create your own shell scriptYou're having fun with aliases, but are they REAL programs, or just glorified shortcuts?This challenge is to create a bash script, a REAL program written in bash. To do this, create a text file (I'll call this one goto-projects.sh) that begins with this line:#!/bin/bash\nUnder that, write some lines of bash that you want to be executed. How about a program that goes to your projects folder from wherever you are?cd ~/Desktop/projects\necho \"Now you're in $(pwd)\"\nYour script should look like this when you're done.goto-projects.sh:#!/bin/bash\n\ncd ~/Desktop/projects\necho \"Now you're in $(pwd)\"\nNow run this command to make your script executable. This gives your computer permission to run it as a program:$ chmod a+x goto-projects.sh\nNow run your program like this:$ ./goto-projects.sh\nChallenge #5: Make your script run from anywhereLast challenge! So you've made a real program in bash, you're probably feeling pretty proud of yourself. Deservedly so. But you still need to be in a folder with your program, and you still need to use that annoying ./ to run it. Let's make our program accessible from anywhere on the system by moving it to the /bin folder.sudo mv goto-projects.sh /bin/goto-projects\nThis moves your script from its current folder to the /bin folder and renames it from goto-projects.sh to goto-projects. Now close your terminal with exit and reopen it. Type$ goto-projects\nfrom anywhere and see if that runs your script. If it does, congratulations!

There are different kinds of databases—one kind is a relational database. In a relational database, the data is contained in different tables.What is SQL?SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language for interacting with data in a relational database. There are different implementations of SQL—one implementation is SQLite. Different implementations (such as PostgreSQL and MySQL) have their own higher level specialized functions, but the all handle the same basic operations covered today.We’re going to use SQLite in this session because getting set up requires less work. SQLite is a little different from other implementations of SQL because it operates on regular plain old local files and does not require a server connection, unlike PostgreSQL and MySQL. The databases you work with in SQLite exist in .db files that you can store anywhere on your computer.How do I use SQL?The database holds your data, but you need a client to see and interact with that data. There are a few options for SQLite GUI database managers. We will be using SQLiteStudio.

You may hear it called different names, such as the terminal, the shell, or bash. In practice, you can use these terms interchangeably. (If you're curious, though, you can read more about them in the glossary.)Why is the command line useful?When I use the command line, I feel like a powerful space-age computer commander. But initially, for some of us, the command line can feel a bit unfamiliar. Why step away from a point-and-click workflow? By using the command line, we move into an environment where we have more minute control over each task we'd like the computer to perform. Instead of ordering your food in a restaurant, you're stepping into the kitchen. It's more work, but there are also more possibilities.The command line allows you to...Easily automate tasks such as creating, copying, and converting files.\n\nSet up your programming environment.\n\nRun programs you create.\n\nAccess the (many) programs and utilities that do not have graphical equivalents.\n\nControl other computers remotely.\n\nIn addition to being a useful tool in itself, the command line gives you access to a second set of programs and utilities and is a complement to learning programming.What if all these cool possibilities seem a bit abstract to you right now? That's alright! On a very basic level, most uses of the command line are about showing information that the computer has, or modifying or making things (files, programs, etc) on the computer.In the next section, we'll make this a little more clear by getting started with the command line. - Next >>>"},"sessions/command-line/sections/getting-to-the-command-line.html":{"url":"sessions/command-line/sections/getting-to-the-command-line.html","title":"Getting to the command line","keywords":"","body":"Getting to the command lineOSXIf you're using OSX:Click the Finder button (the magnifying glass) in the top right of your desktop.\nType \"Terminal\" into the bar that appears.\nSelect the first item that appears in the list.\nThe terminal will look like this:\nWhen you see the $, you're in the right place.Bonus points: if you really want to get the groove of just typing instead of pointing and clicking, you can press \"Command (⌘)\" and the space bar at the same time to pull up Spotlight search, start typing \"Terminal,\" and then hit \"Enter\" to open a terminal window. This will pull up a terminal window without touching your mousepad.

Keep this in mind today, this week, and your whole life. If at first something doesn't work, your spelling will be the first thing you check.Getting started: know thyselfYou may also see your username to the left of the $. Let's try our first command. Type the following and press enter:$ whoami\nThe whoami command should print out your username. Congrats, you've executed your first command! This is a basic pattern of use in the command line: type a command and receive output.Orienting yourself in the command line: foldersOK, we're going to try another command. But first, let's make sure we understand some things about how your computer's filesystem works.Your computer's files are organized in what's known as a hierarchical filesystem. That means there's a top level or \"root\" folder on your system. That folder has other folders in it, and those folders have folders in them, and so on. You can draw these relationships in a tree:Users\n|\n-- patrick\n  |\n  -- Photos\n  -- Documents\nThe root or highest-level folder on OSX is just called /. We won't need to go in there, though, since that's mostly just files for the operating system. On Windows, the root directory is usually called C:.OK, let's try a command that tells us where we are in the filesystem:$ pwd\nYou should get output like /Users/patrick. That means you're in the patrick directory in the Users folder inside the / or root directory. On Windows, your output would instead be C:/Users/patrick. The folder you're in is called the working directory, and pwd stands for \"print working directory.\"I'm a bit of a literalist, so it bears saying: the command pwd won't actually print anything, except on your screen. This command is easier to grasp when we interpret \"print\" as \"display.\"OK, we know where we are. But what if we want to know what files and folders are in the patrick directory, a.k.a. the working directory? Try entering:ls\nYou should see a number of folders, probably including Documents, Desktop, and so on. You may also see some files. These are the contents of the current working directory.I wonder what's in the Desktop folder? Let's try navigating to it with the following command:$ cd Desktop\n(Make sure the \"D\" in \"Desktop\" is capitalized. ) If the command was successful, you won't see any output. This is normal—often, the command line will succeed silently.So how do we know it worked? That's right, let's use our pwd command again. We should get:$ pwd\n/Users/patrick/Desktop\nNow try ls again to see what's on your desktop. These three commands—pwd, ls, and cd—are the most commonly used in the terminal. Between them, you can orient yourself and move around.Compare with the GUIIt's important to note that this is the same old information you can get by pointing and clicking: it's just being displayed to you in a different way.Go ahead and use pointing and clicking to navigate to your working directory--you can get there a few ways, but try starting from \"My Computer\" and clicking down from there. You'll notice that the folder names should match the ones that the command line spits out for you, since it's the same information! We're just using a different mode of navigation around your computer to see it.Before we move on, let's take a minute to navigate through our computer's file system using the command line.ChallengeUse the three commands you've just learned—pwd, ls and cd—eight (8) times each. Go poking around your Photos folder, or see what's so special about that scary root / directory. When you're done, come back to the home folder withcd ~\n(That's a tilde, on the top left of your keyboard.) One more command you might find useful iscd ..\nwhich will move you one directory up in the filesystem. That's a cd with two periods after it. - Next >>>Example:"},"sessions/command-line/sections/creating-files-and-folders.html":{"url":"sessions/command-line/sections/creating-files-and-folders.html","title":"Creating files and folders","keywords":"","body":"Creating files and foldersCreating a fileSo far, we've only performed commands that give us information.

Now move the terminal window and look at your \"real\" desktop, the graphical one. See any differences? If the command was successful and you were in the right place, you should see an empty text file called \"foo.txt\" on the desktop. Pretty cool, right?Handy tip: up arrowLet's say you liked that \"foo.txt\" file so much you'd like another! In the terminal window, press the \"up arrow\" on your keyboard. You'll notice this populates the line with the command that you just wrote. You can hit \"Enter\" to create another \"foo.txt,\" or you could use your left/right arrows to change the file name to \"foot.txt\" to create something different.As we start to write more complicated and longer commands in our terminal, the \"up arrow\" is a great shortcut so you don't have to spend lots of time typing.Creating foldersOK, so we're going to be doing a lot of work during the Digital Research Institute. Let's create a project folder in our home directory so that we can keep all our work in one place.First, let's check to make sure we're still in the Desktop folder with pwd:$ pwd\n/Users/patrick/Desktop\nOnce you've double-checked you're in Desktop, we'll use this command to make a folder called \"projects\":mkdir projects\nNow do ls to see if a projects folder has appeared.

Text editors are programs that allow you to edit plain text files, such as .txt, .py (Python scripts), and .csv (spreadsheet files).

Let me know you've completed them all and I'll give you a bag of candy! And no, it's not cheating if you ask for help.Challenge #1: Create hidden fileUse the touch command to create a hidden file. Hidden files have a . in front of them, like this:$ ls -A\n.gitignore hello.txt\n$ ls\nhello.txt\nYou can also create hidden folders this way, but you only need to create a file to pass the challenge.Challenge #2: Create an aliasAll these commands are great and all, but what if I want to make my own command? For example, maybe I want to make this happen:$ peptalk\nPatrick is awesome!\nTo do this, use the alias command:$ alias peptalk=\"echo 'Patrick is awesome!'\"\nTo pass this challenge, make your own alias that does something different.Challenge #3: Make a permanent aliasSo you made an alias, but you realized it goes away when you close and reopen the terminal. (So unfair.) Make your alias permanent.To do this, you will need to edit the configuration file that your terminal runs when it starts up. On Git Bash, that's going to be called ~/.bashrc. (That's a .bashrc file in your home folder.) ON OSX, the file is called ~/.bash_profile. Just add the command you used to create the alias to the file with your text editor. Close and reopen the terminal to make sure your alias still works.Challenge #4: Create your own shell scriptYou're having fun with aliases, but are they REAL programs, or just glorified shortcuts?This challenge is to create a bash script, a REAL program written in bash. To do this, create a text file (I'll call this one goto-projects.sh) that begins with this line:#!/bin/bash\nUnder that, write some lines of bash that you want to be executed. How about a program that goes to your projects folder from wherever you are?cd ~/Desktop/projects\necho \"Now you're in $(pwd)\"\nYour script should look like this when you're done.goto-projects.sh:#!/bin/bash\n\ncd ~/Desktop/projects\necho \"Now you're in $(pwd)\"\nNow run this command to make your script executable. This gives your computer permission to run it as a program:$ chmod a+x goto-projects.sh\nNow run your program like this:$ ./goto-projects.sh\nChallenge #5: Make your script run from anywhereLast challenge! So you've made a real program in bash, you're probably feeling pretty proud of yourself. Deservedly so. But you still need to be in a folder with your program, and you still need to use that annoying ./ to run it. Let's make our program accessible from anywhere on the system by moving it to the /bin folder.sudo mv goto-projects.sh /bin/goto-projects\nThis moves your script from its current folder to the /bin folder and renames it from goto-projects.sh to goto-projects. Now close your terminal with exit and reopen it. Type$ goto-projects\nfrom anywhere and see if that runs your script. If it does, congratulations!

Starting from when Keith copied everything over from the repo for our old GCDRB (GC Digital Research Bootcamp) website, to fixing broken links, making stylistic tweaks, adding the new application form, and finally closing applications. Each version is logged here.Git tracks changes when the user tells it to git add a file, and git commit logs the different versions you see here. When you git add and git commit, all these files live in the .git repository on your computer.Git is the local power behind version control.What is GitHub?Github is a hosting service for git repositories. You must first set up an account and configure it on your computer. Once your local git repository and a remote GitHub are connected, you can make copies of other users' repositories from GitHub, edit them, and send your proposed changes back to the GitHub repo so that the person who owns that repo can choose to incorporate your changes into their repository.Github connects Git repositories remotely and is the power behind collaboration.If you have not signed up for a GitHub account, go to http://github.com/. Remember to save your user name, email, and password as you will need this information twice more!What is Markdown?Markdown is a markup language for formatting text. Unlike HTML, markdown is designed to be human-readable, which makes it much easier to write and edit.You can think of markdown as a language read by many platforms and sites, including GitHub, to style text. Since markdown is plain text, it's also arguably more sustainable and accessible than formats like .docx. . You'll notice this file is in markdown--check out its extension!To help you format your text (use markdown to translate plain to pizzazz), try this cheat-sheet: GitHub Markdown Cheatsheet.

The last operation is modulo, or mod, which returns the remainder after division.Note the way you interact with Python at the prompt. After entering an expression such as 2 + 3, Python \"evaluates\" it to a simpler form, 5, and then prints out the answer for you. This process is called the Read Eval Print Loop, or REPL. Reading takes commands from you, the input is evaluated or run, the result is printed out, and the prompt is shown again to wait for more input. The normal terminal (the one with the $) is another example of a REPL.The REPL is useful for quick tests and, later, can be used for exploring and debugging your programs interactively.ChallengesFor a few minutes, practice moving in and out of Python's interactive mode (also known as the REPL). You can get out of Python by hitting Control-d or by typing exit(), and you can get back in by typing python at the $ prompt.

You can write them in any text editor, like Sublime Text or Notepad on Windows. When you pass the text file to Python, it runs the code in the file one line at a time. There's nothing special about .py files, they're just regular text files. This makes them work well with command line tools like Git.

For that, we'll need something called a loop:flowers = ['rose', 'violet', 'buttercup']\n# print(flowers)\nfor flower in flowers:\n    print(\"My favorite flower is the\", flower)\nWhat's happening here? This kind of loop is called a \"for\" loop, and tells Python: \"for each item in the list, do something.\" Let's break it down:for  in :\n    \nIndented code like this is known as a \"code block.\" Python will run the  code in the code block once for each item in the list. You can also refer to \\ in the  block.You can also perform more complicated operations. Let's tackle one in a challenge.ChallengeHere's a list of numbers:prime_numbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]\nWrite some code to print out the square of each of these numbers. The solution is here, but you're not allowed to look at it until you've tried to solve it yourself for 3.5 minutes. Seriously. That's 210 seconds.Advanced ChallengeFirst, ignore this challenge because it's too hard. Next, look up string formatting on Google and use it to write a loop that gives the following output:The square of 2 is 4.\nThe square of 3 is 9.\nThe square of 5 is 25.\nThe square of 7 is 49.\nThe square of 11 is 121.\n | Next >>>"},"sessions/python/sections/conditionals.html":{"url":"sessions/python/sections/conditionals.html","title":"Conditionals","keywords":"","body":" | Next >>>ConditionalsConditionals allow programs to change their behavior based on whether some statement is true or false. Let's try this out by writing a script that will give different outputs based on the weather:weather = \"sunny\"\n\nif weather == \"sunny\":\n    print(\"Bring your shades\")\nelse:\n    print(\"I don't know what you should bring! I'm just a little program...\")\nIn our first line, we set a variable weather  to the string \"sunny,\" representing what the weather is like outside. The if statement checks whether the variable weather is set to \"sunny.\" If it is, the code in the block beneath is executed, so the text \"Bring your shades\" will be printed.The else statement handles any inputs that aren't \"sunny\"—the program merely prints out that it doesn't know what you should bring. Try this script out both with the variable set to \"sunny\" and the variable set to some other value.What if we want our program to handle other kinds of weather, giving different messages for each one? Other cases after the first if statement are handled with elif:weather = \"sunny\"\n\nif weather == \"sunny\":\n    print(\"Bring your shades\")\nelif weather == \"rainy\":\n    print(\"Bring your umbrella\")\nelif weather == \"snowy\":\n    print(\"Bring your wooly muffler\")\nelse:\n    print(\"I don't know what you should bring! I'm just a little program...\")\nYou can add as many elif statements as you need, meaning that conditionals in Python have one if statement, any number of elif statements, and one else statement that catches any input not covered by if or elif. Over the next sections, we'll work on improving this little application, making it able to handle user input directly.ChallengeAdd two more elif statements to this program to make it better able to handle different kinds of weather. | Next >>>"},"sessions/python/sections/input.html":{"url":"sessions/python/sections/input.html","title":"Input","keywords":"","body":" | Next >>>InputNote: If you're using Python 2.7, replace all input() functions in the code below with raw_input(). You can check your version by running python --version in the command line.Python allows you to take input directly from the user using the input function. Let's use it to improve our weather application by asking for the weather before displaying the output.weather = input(\"What is the weather like today? \")\n\nif weather == \"sunny\":\n    print(\"Bring your shades\")\nelif weather == \"rainy\":\n    print(\"Bring your umbrella\")\nelif weather == \"snowy\":\n    print(\"Bring your wooly muffler\")\nelse:\n    print(\"I don't know what you should bring! I'm just a little program...\")\nWhen you run this program, Python should ask you for some input with the prompt What is the weather like today? (The space before the second \" makes the prompt look more tidy in the console.) It will then return some advice based on the input. Try running it now.Asking repeatedlyWhat if we want Python to keep asking for input instead of exiting after the first question is answered? For that, we can use something called a while loop.Remember our for loop? Instead of iterating through a list like the for loop, our while loop will continue to execute as long as a certain condition is true. Here's a very simple while loop that will run forever until you quit it manually.while True:\n    print(\"Oh no! I'm stuck...\")\nIn the terminal, you can escape from this endless loop by pressing Control-c on your keyboard.Let's apply the while loop to our weather app:while True:\n    weather = input(\"What is the weather like today? \")\n\n    if weather == \"sunny\":\n        print(\"Bring your shades\")\n    elif weather == \"rainy\":\n        print(\"Bring your umbrella\")\n    elif weather == \"snowy\":\n        print(\"Bring your wooly muffler\")\n    else:\n        print(\"I don't know what you should bring! I'm just a little program...\")\nNotice that we had to shift everything over one tab to fit it in the while block. Now our program will ask us for input again and again, and give us different answers each time.Let's add one more feature: an elif statement that will break us out of the loop and end the program:while True:\n    weather = input(\"What is the weather like today? \")\n\n    if weather == \"sunny\":\n        print(\"Bring your shades\")\n    elif weather == \"quit\":\n        break\n    elif weather == \"rainy\":\n        print(\"Bring your umbrella\")\n    elif weather == \"snowy\":\n        print(\"Bring your wooly muffler\")\n    else:\n        print(\"I don't know what you should bring! I'm just a little program...\")\nThe break command ends the current loop early, ending the program when \"quit\" is given as input.ChallengeHow much of the code above do you understand? Even if you do kind of understand it, do you \"grok\" it—that is, really understand it?\n\nOpen up your REPL (type python at the $ prompt). Play around with input() a bit until you understand it's behavior really well. Write a two-line program in the REPL or in a script that takes some input and echoes it back to the user.Alternatively, mess around with while. Try using things other than True and see if the code in the loop runs. If you can, write a while loop that prints out the numbers from 1 to 10 and stops.(optional) Read a little about the weird word grok.\n\n | Next >>>"},"sessions/python/sections/google.html":{"url":"sessions/python/sections/google.html","title":"Using Google","keywords":"","body":" | Next >>>Finding Answers with GoogleOur weather app is working pretty well, but you may have noticed that it's case sensitive:What is the weather like today? snowy\nBring your wooly muffler\nWhat is the weather like today? SNOWY\nI don't know what you should bring! I'm just a little program...\nHow could we fix our program to handle cases like this? We could add a bunch of new elif statements, like this:[...]\nelif weather == \"snowy\":\n    print(\"Bring your wooly muffler\")\nelif weather == \"SNOWY\":\n    print(\"Bring your wooly muffler\")\n[...]    \nThis is a lot of work, and it's a pretty ugly solution. If we wanted to add more cases to our program, we would have to write them in twice every time, and it still wouldn't fix inputs like Snowy. The best way to improve our program would be to convert the input to lower case before we send it to our if/else block.Googling for answersEven if you're a super rad Python programmer, you're not going to remember every function name or how to do things you might not have touched in awhile. One thing programmers get very good at is googling for answers. In fact, this is arguably the most important skill in modern-day programming. So let's use Google to find out how to convert strings to lower case.Let's try the search term make string lowercase Python:Notice that the first result is from a site called Stack Overflow. This is a questions and answers site for programmers that usually has strong answers to questions about Python.On the Stack Overflow page, take a quick look at the question to make sure it's relevant to your problem. However, we need to scroll down to the answers to find what we're looking for:Also notice the snarky debate below! Another \"feature\" of Stack Overflow.Implementing our answerAccording to this answer, we can make a string lowercase by adding .lower() to the end of it, like this:>>> \"SNOWY\".lower()\n'snowy'\nOK, that seems to work, even if we don't really know what's going on with that dot. Let's incorporate this transformation into our weather app:while True:\n    weather = input(\"What is the weather like today? \")\n    weather = weather.lower()\n\n    if weather == \"sunny\":\n        print(\"Bring your shades\")\n    elif weather == \"quit\":\n        break\n    elif weather == \"rainy\":\n        print(\"Bring your umbrella\")\n    elif weather == \"snowy\":\n        print(\"Bring your wooly muffler\")\n    else:\n        print(\"I don't know what you should bring! I'm just a little program...\")\nThis new script should handle any combination of upper or lowercase characters. The new second line sets the weather variable to a new value, weather.lower(), which is a lowercase version of the original input.There's no shame in googling for answers! Error messages are especially useful to google when you run into them. Keep an eye out for Stack Overflow answers, as they tend to have useful examples. The official Python documentation will also frequently come up, but I would recommend avoiding it as a resource until you have more programming experience. It's a great resource, but the way information is presented can be confusing until you get the hang of reading documentation.ChallengeIs there something you would like to do with Python that we haven't covered yet? Do you find some language feature confusing? Take a minute now to use Google to ask a question about Python. If you can't think of something to google, look up how to append items to lists.\n(optional) OK, I told you not to look at the Python documentation. But doesn't that make you really want to go look at the Python documentation? How bad could this \"documentation\" really be? What terrible secrets might it hold?\nFine. Have a look at the Python documentation on built-in functions.

Our first step will be to create a list of positive sayings:motivational_phrases = [\n        \"Importing modules is easy!\",\n        \"Programming! Yay!\",\n        \"You write lists like a pro!\",\n    ]\nLists open with a square bracket [, have items seperated with commas, and end with a square bracket ], like this:[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nOur positivity list above spreads the list out over multiple lines for greater readability, which is allowed in Python. Remember that you can change the strings in the list to whatever phrases you choose.Importing a moduleNow that we have our sayings, let's use it in conjunction with some functionality from a module that's built into Python: the random module.import random\n\nmotivational_phrases = [\n        \"Importing modules is easy!\",\n        \"Programming! Yay!\",\n        \"You write lists like a pro!\",\n    ]\n\nprint(random.choice(motivational_phrases))\nThe random.choice function chooses a random item from a list and returns it. The . syntax indicates that the function is coming from the random library.The real point of this section is to learn import, which is where Python really starts to get interesting. Python comes with many libraries (importable collections of code), and you can install many more. Think of something you're interested in doing (statistics, text analysis, web scraping, quantitative analysis, processing Excel/PDF/image files) and search google \"\\ python library\". You're almost certain to find some useful results.\n(optional) As with our weather app, this positive saying generator could be improved by making it so the program doesn't have to run again every time to get new output.
