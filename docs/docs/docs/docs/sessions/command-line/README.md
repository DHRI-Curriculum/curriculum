# Introduction to the Command Line

Let's say aliens came to visit our planet, and kindly requested that you show them how to use a computer. How would you show them how to *do* something on your computer?

Most of us would explain what a screen and a mouse are, and then show the alien how to point and click on icons. This approach relies on a graphical user interface, or GUI (pronounced "gooey!"). 

Today we're going to explore another way to make your computer do things: through the command line. Instead of pointing and clicking, we'll be typing in either git bash (Windows) or terminal (OSX) to tell the computer directly what task we'd like it to perform. 

While this new technique can seem intimidating if you haven't used text-based interfaces before, luckily, you can use 90% of the functionality of the command line by becoming comfortable with a very small set of the most common commands.

In this session, we'll learn those common commands by exploring and manipulating a simple data set. By the end of the session, you'll be able to navigate your computer, create and manipulate files, and transform text-based data using only the command line. 

Get ready to impress those aliens with your computer know-how!
