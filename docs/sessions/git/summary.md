# Summary

Through this workshop, we have learned:

Git is for version control  
GitHub is for collaboration  
Markdown is language for formatting text (a way to style plain text)  

`git config` tells Git who is working  
`git init` tells Git which repo to monitor  
`git add` tells Git to track this file  
`git commit` tells Git to log this version (add `-m` to include a note about it)  
`git push` share this local version with a remote GitHub repo  
`git clone` makes a local copy of a remote repo from GitHub  
`git pull` logs any remote changes (like something someone else submitted on GitHub) from GitHub to your local repo  
`git status` tells us if things are in sync  

#### Final note
Remember, what you don't know can _always_ be Googled or looked up on Stack Overflow!
