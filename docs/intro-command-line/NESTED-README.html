Luckily, you can use 90% of the functionality of the command line by becoming comfortable with a very small set of the most common commands.</p><p>In this session, we&apos;ll learn those common commands by exploring and manipulating a simple data set. By the end of the session, you&apos;ll be able to navigate your computer, create and manipulate files, and transform text-based data using only the command line.</p>
