Sessions at the Digital Research Institute are divided into three categories: [core](core.md), which provide a general foundation on which to build more specialized skills; [supplemental](supplemental.md), electives which are more likely to be more useful to researchers in specific areas or disciplines,; and [professional development](professional.md), which focus on non-technical skills necessary for undertaking successful projects.
